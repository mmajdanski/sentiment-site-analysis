# Hi There!

This project was done out of my curiosity on whether sites are mostly positive or negatively biased. Keep in mind that this tool may not work well on all sites depending on how sites chose to "render" their information (largely based on the framework they are using).

**Note**: The analysis of what words are good vs bad was done in the following paper:

Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. "Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews." 
Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge, 
Discovery, and Data Mining (KDD-2004), Aug 22-25, 2004, Seattle, Washington, USA,
